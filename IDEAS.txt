üéØ IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
===============================================================================

STARTING OUT:
1. Pick ONE small feature to implement completely
2. Test thoroughly before moving to the next feature
3. Document your changes as you go
4. Don't be afraid to refactor existing code
5. Ask questions in OS development communities

TESTING:
- Test in both QEMU and VirtualBox if possible
- Create test cases for new functionality
- Test error conditions, not just the happy path
- Use debug printing liberally
- Keep backups of working versions

RESOURCES:
- OSDev Wiki (good technical reference despite the attitude)
- James Molloy's kernel tutorials
- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (free online book)
- Intel Software Developer Manuals
- AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual

===============================================================================

Remember: The goal is to learn and have fun! Start small, build incrementally,
and don't worry about making everything perfect. Every feature you add will
teach you something new about how operating systems work.

Happy coding!
